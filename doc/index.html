<h1>GLERI</h1>
<p>
If you are writing a graphical application on Linux and want it to take
advantage of GPU hardware that every computer has these days, your only
option is to use OpenGL, because that is the only API exposed by the
drivers. Unfortunately, using OpenGL is not without its problems.
</p><p>
The most acute problem is inability to run your applications remotely.
X and Unix in general have a long history of allowing remote use, a very
useful capability in many circumstances, but while there is an X extension
(GLX) allowing OpenGL remoting, it is restricted to the ancient version
1.2 API that does not support essential capabilities such as vertex
buffer objects. Furthermore, GLX is at this time being deprecated in
favor of EGL, and will be replaced by it in some near future. Even worse,
the entire X11 protocol is in danger of disappearing and being replaced
by Wayland, which is not designed for remote use.
</p><p>
Another problem is the libraritis infection you get by having to link
to the OpenGL shared library. No static library is available for this,
so no statically linked executables can be created. The OpenGL library is
huge and contains a lot of low-level tie-ins to the kernel driver guts,
resulting in bloat and instability. Crashing your application may cause
a kernel panic, just like in good old Windows 3.1, which likewise made
the mistake of putting driver guts into user application process space.
The driver initialization sequence can also be slow (~.3s), and must be
done every time you start your application.
</p><p>
Finally, one must mention the problem of debugging an OpenGL application.
If you happen to hit a breakpoint at some location unexpected by the
driver developers, sometimes you would not be able to switch to the
debugger because you've just trapped something critical in the driver
and stopped all X rendering. Often, this situation requires a hard power
cycle. After a while you give up trying the debugger at all.
</p><p>
Now, wouldn't it be nice if there was a network protocol letting us
write applications that use OpenGL remotely, without linking to the
entire graphics driver? Well, GLERI is it.
