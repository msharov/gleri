<h1>GLERI Internals</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
Here you'll find a high-level overview of the internal design of
GLERI, written for those wishing to modify the library. If you are only
interested in using it to write your own applications, you should instead
look at the tutorials and the API reference.
</p>

<h2>Build system</h2>
<p>
The build system mimics autoconf, but is not. configure is a custom
made script with similar functionality, written to avoid autoconf bloat.
The generated autoconf files were several times larger than the entire
GLERI project, so that was the motivation. Usage is the same. See
<tt>./configure --help</tt> for available options. If you're developing,
you'll probably want to install to <tt>--prefix=$HOME</tt>.  configure
will detect available libraries, like libpng, and other dependencies
listed in the root README, and will output <tt>Config.mk</tt>,
<tt>config.h</tt>, and <tt>gleri/config.h</tt>. <tt>Config.mk</tt> holds
makefile defines, <tt>gleri/config.h</tt> has defines used by the library,
and <tt>config.h</tt> is used only by gleris.
</p><p>
The makefile is nonrecursive and will include .mk modules from
subdirectories to build submodules. To work with this type of makefile
it is convenient to define a shell alias to allow building from from
any directory by walking up the tree until a makefile is hit. The one
I use is available on GitHub <a href="https://gist.github.com/msharov/7377320">gist</a>.
</p><p>
Object files and dependencies will go into .o subdirectory. Executables
stay in the main tree for convenience.
</p>

<h2>Component Layout</h2>
<p>
GLERI project consists of two main parts - the gleris service that
uses OpenGL and Xlib, and the gleri library for writing applications
using gleris for graphics output. The library files are located in the
gleri subdirectory, and gleris sources are in the root. There is a test
program in the test subdirectory that calls all the APIs to make sure
they still work. doc subdirectory contains documentation and tutorials.

<h2>Client Internals</h2>
<p>
GLERI implements a client-server framework for OpenGL. The client side is
in the gleri library. Clients define an app object, CGLApp, and use it to
create CWindow objects which communicate through a socket connection to
gleris to instantiate the corresponding resources through OpenGL and Xlib.
See <a href="protocol.html">protocol specification</a> for more detail
on each protocol and their calls.
</p><p>
CWindow objects are created by calling the CGLApp::CreateWindow
template and remain owned by the app object. Closing a window is a bit
more complicated. CWindow derivative calls Close(). Close sends a close
request to the server and sets the _closePending flag, preventing any
further commands being sent to the server by this window.  On the server,
CGleris receives the close request and destroys the X window.  X server
destroys the window and sends DestroyNotify message. CGleris forwards that
to the client as CEvent::Destroy, destroys the context and all associated
resources, and removes the CGLWindow object. In the client, CWindow
receives the destroy event and sets the _destroyPending flag, which
causes the window object to be deleted in CGTApp::FinishWindowProcessing.
</p><p>
This convoluted procedure exists to ensure complete cleanup on both
sides of the connection, and to handle the different ways a window can be
closed. A window can be closed by calling CWindow::Close on the client,
by the window manager via the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol, by one of the
client requests resulting in an exception being thrown on the server, or
finally the window can just die for no reason because X doesn't like it.
All these scenarios plug into appropriate points of the procedure above,
depending on what has already been destroyed.
</p><p>
Window draw can be initiated explicitly by CWindow::Draw or automatically
upon receiving CEvent::Expose. Both client and server will frame limit to
vsync. CWindow does it by postponing drawlist creation until vsync. gleris
will drop incoming frame drawlists, keeping only the latest received
until it can be rendered once vsync fires. vsync rate on the client is
synchronized by CEvent::FrameSync, and kept current with CApp timers.
</p><p>
Drawing and resource creation must be done separately because the entire
drawlist is sent as a single RGL command, just as resource creation
commands are. To use the COM message headers for the drawlist commands
would be inefficient - there is just too much overhead. There are
additional advantages of having a natural frame boundary to know when
to swap buffers, and optimizations that can be made when it is known
that all OpenGL resources will stay valid until the end of the drawlist.
</p><p>
Drawlist creation is done in two passes, first writing to bstrs to
determine the size, and then to bstro to write the actual data. This
is a more efficient solution than resizing the buffer on every command;
frequently the size is a constant, and the first pass produces no runtime
overhead. The disadvantage is that OnDraw must be a template. That is
somewhat remedied with the ONDRAW macros.
</p><p>
CWindow always represents a toplevel window. Subwindows exist only on
the client, implemented by CWidget and derivatives. Widgets pretend
to be the parent CWindow object when sending commands to the server,
making it possible for widgets to create resources. One drawback of this
is the need to duplicate the PRGL API in CWidget. The drawlists made
by widgets must be aggregated by the parent window and sent as a single
frame drawlist. CPackbox class is inteded for this purpose as a generic
widget container, typically used as a single member object in the host
window. Forwarding to it will correctly handle drawlist aggregation and
event routing.
</p><p>
Widgets can send UI commands that are local to the client
process. Menu commands are an example of this. Dialog buttons and
change notifications would be another. UI events are sent using
<tt>CGLApp::Instance().SendUICommand (const char* cmd)</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Server Internals</h2>
<p>
The server has the app object <tt>CGleris</tt> in <tt>gleris.h,cc</tt>.
CGleris manages process-level setup and events, manages connections
(CIConn), deals with Xlib and GLX. At startup it creates a hidden
window and a root OpenGL context to allow resource sharing across
all clients. Each GL context will have sharing enabled with the
root context. Client connections are accepted through stdin when
launched for a single client (-s), through the TCP socket (when -t
is given), and through a UNIX socket. The UNIX socket is usually
placed in <tt>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt>, when available. Otherwise it's in
<tt>~/.config</tt>.
</p><p>
Each client connection has a corresponding <tt>CIConn</tt> object,
implemented in <tt>iconn.h,cc</tt>. <tt>CIConn</tt>'s main purpose is to
manage resource objects. Resource objects are shared among all windows
in the connection. Resource objects are implemented in <tt>go*.h,cc</tt>,
and contain metrics and loading code. Default resources, like the default
font, are loaded at startup into the root context.
</p><p>
Each window has a corresponding CGLWindow object. The window
list is maintained in CGleris, not CIConn, because the most common use
of routing Xlib messages to each window is done there, in OnXEvent.
</p><p>
Window drawing is initiated in CGleris::ClientDraw by client command
parsed by PRGL::Parse, called by CCmdBuf::ProcessMessages, called by
CGleris::OnFd. When a frame limiter queues a pending frame, stored
in CGLWindow::_pendingFrame, its drawing is initiated by timer in
CGleris::OnTimer. Vsync detection is implemented with query objects;
code in CGLWindow::DrawFrame. Once vsync fires, the query after that
becomes available and is detected there. Using queries also measures
frame rendering time that is passed to the client in CEvent::FrameSync.
CGLWindow::_nextVSync is then computed and returned to CGleris to
wait for.
</p><p>
CGLWindow keeps track of active GL objects and tries to avoid setting
them too frequently. See CGLWindow::_cur* variables. These caches are
reset at least once per frame, in CGLWindow::ParseDrawlist.
</p><p>
CGLWindow::CheckForErrors is called after each RGL command in PRGL::Parse.
It checks for OpenGL errors and throws an exception. Exceptions caused
by client code are always fatal and will result in the window being
destroyed. In debug builds CheckForErrors is also called after every
draw command to ease debugging.  For debugging, run gleris with -d,
enabling tracing of every call made, parameters, and failing packets.
