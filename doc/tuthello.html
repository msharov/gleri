<h1>Hello World</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
This tutorial explains how to create a barebones GLERI application
that draws something in a window and quits. Adhering to tradition,
we'll print "Hello world!".
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>
<p>
The code for this tutorial is included in the GLERI tarball, located under
the <tt>tut/hello</tt> subdirectory. When you build GLERI, the tutorials
are automatically build as well. In your own makefile provide include
paths to the location of <tt>gleri.h</tt> and the <tt>libgleri.a</tt>
library. By default, these are installed to <tt>/usr/include</tt>
and <tt>/usr/lib</tt> respectively. The project executable needs to be
linked with <tt>libgleri.a</tt>.
</p><p>
To run the project, the gleris service must either be running, with
UNIX socket in <tt>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt>, TCP socket 6540, have systemd
listening on those sockets and activate it, or be in <tt>PATH</tt> to
be launched in single-client mode. The gleris service is the part of the
system that will actually use Xlib and OpenGL to create windows and draw
on them. Each GLERI client application will connect to a gleris process
through a socket and send commands for window creation and drawing.
</p>

<h2>The Application Object</h2>
<p>
GLERI uses an object-oriented framework, with the root object being a
singleton application object. All other objects are created and owned by
this application object. This design is the easiest way to ensure that
all objects get correctly destroyed in case of program termination.
The application object will install signal handlers and will, in case
of crashes, exceptions, C++ terminate, etc., clean up everything it
owns on exit. Each program's application object must be derived from
<tt>CGLApp</tt>, and must provide a singleton interface in form of the
static <tt>Instance()</tt> call and a private constructor.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;gleri.h&gt;

class CHello : public CGLApp {
    CHello (void) : CGLApp() {}
public:
    static CHello&amp; Instance (void) {
	static CHello s_App; return (s_App);
    }
    void Init (argc_t argc, argv_t argv) {
	CGLApp::Init (argc, argv);
	CreateWindow&lt;CHelloWindow&gt;();
    }
};

GLERI_APP (CHello)
</pre>
<p>
Here you see an empty private default constructor, simply initializing
the base class. Then there is the singleton <tt>Instance</tt> call, that
creates the application object. Using a local static variable registers
the destructor via <tt>atexit</tt>, ensuring correct cleanup whenever
the process exits. The <tt>Init</tt> function is called directly from
<tt>main</tt> with process arguments. Here the only action is to create
the hello window, with class <tt>CHelloWindow</tt> defined below. All
windows must be created this way. <tt>CreateWindow</tt> will return
a pointer to the created window. Window objects are always owned by
the application object, so this pointer should not be deleted. In this
tutorial, we do not need to access the window directly, so the pointer
is ignored.
</p><p>
At the end, there must be exactly one line containing <tt>GLERI_APP</tt>,
a macro to generate a <tt>main()</tt> for the application using the
provided application class.
</p>

<h2>The Window Object</h2>
<pre>
class CHelloWindow : public CWindow {
public:
                  CHelloWindow (iid_t wid) : CWindow(wid) {}
    virtual void  OnInit (void);
    ONDRAWDECL    OnDraw (Drw&amp; drw) const;
    virtual void  OnKey (key_t key);
};
</pre><p>
Window classes given to <tt>CGLApp::CreateWindow</tt> must be derived
from the <tt>CWindow</tt> class. <tt>CWindow</tt> encapsulates all
window-related operations, and is defined in <tt>gleri/window.h</tt>.
</p><p>
Each window class must define at least three functions. First is
the constructor, taking one argument that is the window instance id.
Second is the <tt>OnInit</tt> override, called after the connection
to gleris has been established. Third is the <tt>OnDraw</tt> call
that creates the drawlist for the window. You will also likely want
to override one of the event handlers, like <tt>OnKey</tt> here.
</p><p>
An important design requirement that must be mentioned here is that
resource creation and drawing must be done separately. There is a variety
of complicated technical reasons for this limitation that more or less
boil down to "it would be difficult and inefficient to implement it
otherwise". From the library user's perspective this means that you
can only use drawing commands in <tt>OnDraw</tt> - the ones that are
implemented by the passed in <tt>drw</tt> object. Buffers and textures
have to be created and modified elsewhere, typically in <tt>OnInit</tt>,
<tt>OnResize</tt>, <tt>OnKey</tt>, <tt>OnTimer</tt>, or wherever else
the actual changes are triggered. You may recognize this as a form of
document-view architecture.
</p><p>
Another design point that must be mentioned here is that <tt>OnDraw</tt>
is a template. To write a drawlist into a network packet you can do
one of two things: put code in every drawing command to check if there
is enough space in the buffer and resize as needed, or calculate the
size of the drawlist first, allocate the buffer to the full size,
and then write the data. GLERI uses the second approach, because it
is considerably more efficient. The drawback is that <tt>OnDraw</tt>
must be called twice - first to measure, then again to write. Because
<tt>OnDraw</tt> is const and does not create or destroy anything, the
size of the drawlist is typically very simple to calculate, and the first
call becomes either a simple constant (as it will in this tutorial), or
a very simple calculation. To make the template boilerplate code creation
a little easier, two macros, <tt>ONDRAWDECL</tt> and <tt>ONDRAWIMPL</tt>
are provided for declaring and defining <tt>OnDraw</tt>.
</p><pre>
void CHelloWindow::OnInit (void)
{
    CWindow::OnInit();
    Open ("Hello World", 320, 240);
}
</pre><p>
Somewhere in <tt>OnInit</tt>, each window object must call <tt>Open</tt>
(see <tt>PRGL::Open</tt> in <tt>gleri/rglp.h</tt>) to tell gleris to
create a window on the screen. Here, the first argument is the window
title, followed by dimensions. A second <tt>Open</tt> variant is available
for windows that need to specify more parameters. The second argument
to that one is a <tt>G::WinInfo</tt> structure. After the <tt>Open</tt>
call you can create resources, such as vertex buffers or textures,
and call <tt>Draw()</tt>. This tutorial does not draw any primitives,
and so does not need any resources.
</p><pre>
ONDRAWIMPL(CHelloWindow)::OnDraw (Drw&amp; drw) const
{
    CWindow::OnDraw (drw);
    drw.Clear (RGB(0,0,64));
    drw.Color (RGB(128,128,128));
    static const char c_HelloMessage[] = "Hello world!";
    drw.Text ((Info().w-Font()-&gt;Width(c_HelloMessage))/2,
              (Info().h-Font()-&gt;Height())/2,
	      c_HelloMessage);
}
</pre><p>
The drawing function is defined with the help of the <tt>ONDRAWIMPL</tt>
macro taking the class name. The <tt>drw</tt> parameter a templated
type <tt>PDraw</tt>, defined in <tt>gleri/drawp.h</tt>, implementing
the commands for drawlist creation. This drawlist consists of clearing
the screen with a blue background, setting a gray drawing color, and
printing "Hello world!" in the middle of the window.
</p><p>
For colors, <tt>RGBA</tt> function is also available for drawing
transparent primitives. On the gleris side, the color becomes shader
parameter "Color" for the default shader. In OpenGL 3.3, the fixed
pipeline is gone and all applications must write their own shaders.
For basic 2D stuff that can be rather cumbersome, so gleris implements
two default shaders for 2D. The first one, enabled by default is the
<tt>G::default_FlatShader</tt>, will draw flat-shaded primitives with
the specified color. The second one, <tt>G::default_GradientShader</tt>,
will draw smoothly shaded primitives and takes a per-vertex color value.
</p><p>
Although <tt>PDraw</tt> does provide this default 2D functionality,
it most definitely is possible to draw in 3D. You'll just have to write
your own shaders and transform matrices, just as you would when using
plain OpenGL, but with the <tt>drw.</tt> prefix instead of <tt>gl</tt>.
OpenGL programming is a pretty big subject and is outside the scope of
this tutorial. Please consult the excellent tutorials available on <a
href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">www.opengl-tutorial.org</a>.
There are many more available around the net; just make sure you're
looking at the ones targeting the GL3.3 core profile version. The API
for the versions prior to 3.3 is very different and its programming
style is not supported in GLERI.
</p><p>
The <tt>Font</tt> call returns a <tt>G::Font::Info</tt> structure (defined
in <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt>) for the default font, containing font metrics
for measuring text as shown. Passing a font id to <tt>Font</tt> would
return the info structure for the specified font. The default font, along
with the default shaders, is available from the start and is shared among
all applications connected to one gleris process. Resources created by
each application are automatically shared among all windows created by a
single connection. For example, if hello were to create two windows and
load a buffer in one, the buffer could also be accessed from the other,
but would not be available to other processes using the same gleris.
</p><p>
The <tt>Info</tt> call returns the window's <tt>G::WinInfo</tt> structure
(defined in <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt>) that contains current window state.
The info structure is updated every time the window receives a resize
event, which happens at least once after the window is mapped to the
screen.
</p><pre>
void CHelloWindow::OnKey (key_t key)
{
    CWindow::OnKey (key);
    if (key == Key::Escape || key == 'q')
	Close();
}
</pre><p>
Finally, the <tt>OnKey</tt> handler allows quitting the program. Here,
<tt>Close</tt> is called to close this window. Because after it is closed
there will be no windows left, the application object will automatically
quit. You can also explicitly call <tt>CGLApp::Instance().Quit()</tt>
to quit even when there are other windows currently open.
</p><p>
<tt>Key::Escape</tt> is defined in <tt>gleri/event.h</tt>, where you can
find the other supported key codes. Printable characters are passed in
as they are. Modifier keys are ORed onto the <tt>key</tt> value. For example,
when Ctrl and q are pressed, you'll get <tt>KMod::Ctrl|'q'</tt>.
</p><p>
So now you know how to create a GLERI application, how to draw a text,
and how to quit. This is enough to write a WordPerfect 5.1 clone.
