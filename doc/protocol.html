<h1>GLERI Protocols</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
This document contains low-level implementation details of GLERI, intended
for people wishing to modify the library or to enable interoperation with
other services. It is not useful if you only want to write applications
using GLERI.
</p><p>
GLERI communicates over a socket connection, UNIX or TCP, using the
protocols described here. These protocols are implemented on top of a
more or less generic message bus system. The message bus itself uses
the COM protocol, while the GLERI functionality is implemented by the
RGL and RGLR protocol pair. Also described here is the compiled drawlist
format that forms the RGL.Draw message.
</p>

<h2>The Message Bus</h2>
<p>
The messaging protocol is implemented in gleri/cmd.h. Messages are sent
to a remote object through a local proxy object. For example, the RGL
protocol is implemented in gleris by the CGleris and CGLWindow classes,
CGleris managing the open windows and CGLWindow representing each window.
These objects are created and accessed through the PRGL proxy object,
by convention having a name prefixed with P. Each connection is strictly
one-way, and instead of replies a reply interface is defined. In gleris,
the RGL interface is represented by PRGL-&gt;CGLWindow, and the reply
interface is represented by the PRGLR-&gt;CWindow link. Note the ending
of the reply proxy name with an R - this is required by the code to
differentiate between the outgoing and reply protocols. Server proxies
can create remote objects, while reply proxies can only contact existing
objects.
</p><p>
Proxy objects are designed to permit using remote objects in the same
manner as using a local object. Member functions of a proxy objects
serialize arguments into a message and place it into an outgoing buffer
implemented by CCmdBuf class, from which all proxy objects must be
derived. At some convenient point, the contents of the message buffer have
to be written to the socket. In GLERI, this is done by the app object
which owns the socket.
</p><p>
Remote objects are addressed by a string name, such as "RGL". Object
versions, if present, should be made part of the name, like "RGL2",
permitting an executable to support multiple object versions
simultaneously. Each created object has an instance id, encoded
in each message. Method names are also strings, consisting of the
name and argument signature concatenated with a zero. For example,
"LoadData\0uqquuay". The signature contains letters designating the
type of each argument. The meaning of the letters has been copied from
the specification for DBus, which uses a similar system for encoding
arguments. Unless otherwise specified, all arguments are encoded
directly, as in <tt>*(uint32_t*)p = arg;</tt> integer byte order is always
little-endian, here and elsewhere in the protocol.  Values must be aligned
to the same alignment requrement as in memory. Typically that is the size
of the type.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>y</td><td>uint8_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>q</td><td>uint16_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>n</td><td>int16_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>u</td><td>uint32_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>i</td><td>int32_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>x</td><td>uint64_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>t</td><td>int64_t</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td><td>float</td></tr>
<tr><td>d</td><td>double</td></tr>
<tr><td>b</td><td>bool. Encoded as uint8_t.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>Array. The next letter denotes array type. Encoded with uint32_t
    number of elements followed by the serialized array elements, padded
    to 4-byte alignment. If the elements require alignment greater than
    4, the first element is aligned to the appropriate grain.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>s</td>
<td>String. Encoding same as array, with size equal to the length of
    the string including the zero terminator.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>h</td><td>File descriptor. Only valid for messages sent over a
    UNIX socket. No dummy data is sent with the SCM_RIGHTS call, use
    the message itself as msg_iov data required for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>()</td><td>Delimit compound types. Useful after <tt>a</tt></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The message consists of header and body. The header, the body, and the
end of the message must be 8-byte aligned. The header is:
</p><pre>
struct {
    uint32_t    sz;
    uint16_t    iid;
    uint8_t     fdoffset;
    uint8_t     hsz;
    char	objname[];
    char	method[];
    char	signature[];
}
</pre><p>
<tt>sz</tt> is the size of the message body padded to 8 byte alignment.
<tt>hsz</tt> is the size of the header padded to 8 byte alignment.
<tt>fdoffset</tt> is the offset of the passed file descriptor in the body;
if no file descriptor is passed, this should be <tt>0xff</tt>.
<tt>iid</tt> is the instance id of the destination object. Generated by
the caller. <tt>iid</tt> must be unique for the connection, not just for each
object type.
<tt>objname</tt>,
<tt>method</tt>, and
<tt>signature</tt> encode the message destination as described above.
All three are zero-terminated strings, concatenated together and directly
following <tt>hsz</tt>.
</p><p>
The typical implementation defines a proxy object and a server object.
The proxy object defines all methods, marshalling the arguments into
the message buffer, and the server parser template. Putting the code for
outgoing marshalling and the result parser in one place is intended to
simplify the notoriously unpleasant debugging of serialization errors.
It also allows multiple server object implementations and attaching the
remoting capability to objects not written for it, such as ones in third
party libraries.
</p>

<h2>COM</h2>
<p>
The COM interface contains functionality internal to the message bus
protocol. There are two methods currently defined:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Export (const char* el)</tt>, signature "<tt>s</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Must the first message sent by both sides after establishing a
    connection. The argument is a comma-delimited list of supported
    protocols. Reply protocols are included.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Error (const char* msg)</tt>, signature "<tt>s</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Sent by the server object when it encounters an error. In the GLERI
    implementation this is done automatically by the top level parser in
    CCmdBuf by catching and forwarding exceptions. CGLApp will convert
    these into thrown exceptions in the client.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Delete (void)</tt>, signature "<tt></tt>".</dt>
<dd>A notification sent by the server object when it deletes itself
    for any reason other than an error.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RGL</h2>
<p>
This is the server GLERI protocol, defined in <tt>gleri/rglp.h</tt> and
implemented by two gleris objects <tt>CGleris</tt> and <tt>CGLWindow</tt>.
Its interface provides functionality for creating and manipulating windows
and OpenGL resources. For several technical reasons there is an enforced
split between creating resources, such as vertex buffers and textures,
and rendering them. Resources can be loaded from raw data, from files, or
from a datapak, which is a gzip compressed cpio archive.  Resource types
are defined by the <tt>PRGL::EResource</tt> enum in <tt>gleri/rglp.h</tt>,
corresponding to the OpenGL objects named by the like-named <tt>GL_</tt>
constants.
</p><p>
Resource ids are generated by the client object and must be unique to
the connection because all resources are automatically shared between
all windows created by a connection. There are also resources shared
globally among all windows owned by one instance of gleris. These
resources have ids less than <tt>G::default_ResourceMaxId</tt>, which
are reserved for this purpose. Default resources are defined by the
<tt>G::DefaultResource</tt> enum in <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt>.
</p><p>
Once a resource is created, the server object will send a resource info
back to the client, contents dependent on the resource type. Textures will
send a G::Texture::Header, containing texture dimensions and format. Fonts
send a G::Font::Info, containing font metrics for measuring text.
</p><p>
After resources are created, they can be drawn on the screen or an offscreen
framebuffer by using the Draw call. See section below on the format of the
drawlist. The Draw call serves as an atomic frame boundary, containing
everything needed to render one complete frame. The drawlist can be reused
multiple times by the server object to redraw the window, which is one of
the reasons for the resource creation vs drawing separation.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Auth (SArgv argv, const char* hostname, pid_t pid, unsigned screen,
	SDataBlock authdata</tt>, signature "<tt>aysuuay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>A connection-wide authentication call to be used once at startup,
    right after the COM::Export message. Contains information about the
    client process, used to set various X window properties for the
    window manager, and the X11 authentication token, used to verify
    that the client has access to the display.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Open (G::WinInfo winfo, const char* title)</tt>, signature "<tt>(nnqqqyyyyyy)s</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Opens a window with requested parameters. Note that this is always a
    top-level window, X-parented to root - subwindows are not supported
    because they do not play well with OpenGL. The parent window id in
    winfo is an iid of another window created in the same connection,
    and is used to set an X property for the window manager. The
    <tt>G::WinInfo</tt> structure is defined in <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt>.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Close (void)</tt>, signature "<tt></tt>".</dt>
<dd>Closes the calling window.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Draw (goid_t fb, SDataBlock dl</tt>, signature "<tt>uay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Renders drawlist <tt>dl</tt> to framebuffer <tt>fb</tt>. The format
    of the drawlist is documented in the next section. If rendering to the
    screen (G::default_Framebuffer), buffer swap is initiated at the end.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Event (CEvent e)</tt>, signature "<tt>(unnuu)</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Sends a client event. The <tt>CEvent</tt> structure is defined
    in <tt>gleri/event.h</tt>. Currently this is only used to implement
    the _NET_WM_PING protocol.
</dd>
<dt><tt>LoadData (goid_t id, EResource dtype, uint16_t hint, SDataBlock data)</tt>, signature "<tt>uqquuay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Creates a resource of <tt>dtype</tt> from <tt>data</tt> with
    resource-specific <tt>hint</tt>. The <tt>id</tt> is generated by
    the client, and must be a new id. Load calls create a new OpenGL
    object and thus require a new id. The <tt>data</tt> will be sent in
    the message body. The two uint32_t fields before the data block are
    fragment infos, a sending mode not currently implemented.
</dd>
<dt><tt>LoadFile (goid_t id, EResource dtype, uint16_t hint, int fd)</tt>, signature "<tt>uqqh</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Creates a resource of <tt>dtype</tt> from the contents of open file
    <tt>fd</tt>. This call is only valid for UNIX sockets where the file
    descriptor can be directly passed to the server. PRGL will determine
    if this capability is available and will otherwise fallback to
    <tt>LoadData</tt>, reading the file into the message body.
</dd>
<dt><tt>LoadPakFile (goid_t id, EResource dtype, uint16_t hint, goid_t datapak, const char* file)</tt>, signature "<tt>uqqus</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Creates a resource of <tt>dtype</tt> from a <tt>file</tt> in
    <tt>datapak</tt>.
</dd>
<dt><tt>FreeResource (goid_t id, EResource dtype)</tt>, signature "<tt>uq</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Frees resource <tt>id</tt> of <tt>dtype</tt>.
</dd>
<dt><tt>BufferSubData (goid_t id, uint32_t offset, SDataBlock data)</tt>, signature "<tt>uuay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Rewrites part of a buffer resource <tt>id</tt> at <tt>offset</tt>
    with <tt>data</tt>. <tt>id</tt> must have been created by an earler
    call to one of the Load functions above.
</dd>
<dt><tt>TexParameter (G::TextureType t, G::Texture::Parameter p, int v)</tt>, signature "<tt>qqi</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Sets a texture parameter <tt>p</tt> for texture type <tt>t</tt>
    to <tt>v</tt>. See <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt> for the list of available
    parameters. Typically this is used to enable texture smoothing. The
    parameter set will be used for subsequently loaded textures.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RGLR</h2>
<p>
The reply side of the RGL protocol is used by the server object to
send back events and other information to the window object in the
client. In GLERI the proxy and parser are implemented by <tt>PRGLR</tt> in
<tt>gleri/rglrp.h</tt> and <tt>CWindow</tt> in <tt>gleri/window.h</tt>.
As mentioned above, <tt>CWindow</tt> always represents a toplevel
window. Subwindows are implemented strictly on the client with
<tt>CWidget</tt> objects.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Restate (G::WinInfo info)</tt>, signature "<tt>(nnqqyyyy)</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Contains the current window <tt>info</tt> structure, sent whenever
    it changes, such as after creation or resizing.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Expose (void)</tt>, signature "<tt></tt>".</dt>
<dd>A request to redraw the window.
</dd>
<dt><tt>Event (CEvent e)</tt>, signature "<tt>(unnuu)</tt>".</dt>
<dd>UI event. See <tt>gleri/event.h</tt> for the <tt>CEvent</tt>
    structure and various constants for values therein.
</dd>
<dt><tt>SaveFB (goid_t fbid, uint32_t reserved, int fd)</tt>, signature "<tt>uuh</tt>".</dt>
<dd>A reply to the <tt>SaveFramebuffer</tt> command in a drawlist,
    contains the id of the saved framebuffer and the descriptor of the
    file with the saved data. This message is used only on UNIX sockets;
    use the <tt>SaveFBData</tt> call to send the framebuffer data in
    the message body.
</dd>
<dt><tt>SaveFBData (goid_t fbid, const char* filename, uint32_t totalsz,
		    uint32_t offset, SDataBlock data)</tt>, signature "<tt>usuuay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Same as the <tt>SaveFB</tt> message, only with the framebuffer
    <tt>data</tt> embedded in the message body. The destination
    <tt>filename</tt> requested by the <tt>SaveFramebuffer</tt> command
    is included so the client can create that file. The <tt>totalsz</tt>
    and <tt>offset</tt> values are for the currently unimplemented
    fragment mode.
</dd>
<dt><tt>ResInfo (goid_t resid, EResource type, uint16_t reserved, SDataBlock data</tt>, signature "<tt>uqqay</tt>".</dt>
<dd>Sent after creating the resource <tt>resid</tt> of
    <tt>type</tt>. <tt>data</tt> contains the serialized
    resource-specific information structure. Texture resources
    send a <tt>G::Texture::Header</tt>. Font resources send
    <tt>G::Font::Info</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Drawlist Format</h2>
<p>
The drawlist sent in the <tt>RGL::Draw</tt> is composed from a list
of draw commands written using the <tt>PDraw</tt> object, defined in
<tt>gleri/drawp.h</tt>. Each command begins with a <tt>struct header {
ECmd cmd; uint16_t sz; }</tt>, <tt>cmd</tt> being the command id from the
<tt>PDraw::ECmd</tt> enum, and <tt>sz</tt> being the size of the arguments
following the header. Each command must be a multiple of 4 bytes in size.
</p><p>
Most of the commands directly correspond to the OpenGL function of the
same name. The default environment is set up for 2D drawing, so if that's
all you're doing, you should not need to deal with writing shaders. This
by no means implies that GLERI only allows 2D output, but if you want to
do 3D, you'll need to write your own shaders, build the transform matrix,
and do all the other things just as described in OpenGL tutorials you'll
find elsewhere. GLERI uses core profiles, so look at GL 3.3 tutorials.
</p><p>
There are two default shaders available. <tt>G::default_FlatShader</tt>
will fill primitives with a solid color, set by the <tt>Color</tt>
command. The primitives are defined by <tt>x,y</tt> <tt>int16_t</tt>
pairs, ordered counterclockwise. Right hand coordinate system is in use.
The second shader is <tt>G::default_GradientShader</tt>, which takes an
additional <tt>uint32_t</tt> color parameter per vertex, and produces
smoothly shaded primitives.
</p><p>
See <tt>gleri/gldefs.h</tt> for the definitions of the <tt>G::</tt>
constants.
